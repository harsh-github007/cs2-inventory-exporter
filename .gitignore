Your GitHub repository now contains all the code needed to run the website.

### ðŸš€ Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

This is the final step where you bring your website to life.

1.  Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up using your GitHub account.
2.  On your Vercel dashboard, click **Add New...** -> **Project**.
3.  Find your `cs2-inventory-exporter` repository and click the **Import** button next to it.
4.  You don't need to change any build settings. Expand the **Environment Variables** section.
5.  Add a new variable:
    * **Name**: `STEAM_API_KEY`
    * **Value**: Paste the **Steam API Key** you copied in Step 1.
    * Make sure the "Secret" type is selected.
6.  Click **Add**.



7.  Finally, click the **Deploy** button.

Vercel will now build your project from the files in your GitHub repository. In about a minute, you'll see a "Congratulations!" screen with a link to your live website. You can now use it to export any public CS2 inventory to a CSV file.
